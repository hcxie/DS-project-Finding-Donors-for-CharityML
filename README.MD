# Installation

The required python package includes:numpy, pandas,time,Ipython and visuals

# Project Motivation
CharityML is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley that was established to provide financial support for people eager to learn machine learning. CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually.  Therefore, an algorithm needs to be developed to identify potential donors whose income is more than $50000 annually. This could help reduce overhead cost of sending mail and increase donation yield.

# File descriptions
Finding_donors.ipynb -> This file contains the code and results for this project
visual.py -> This is the module  that needs to be imported into the jupyter notebook
census.csv -> the raw data set
# Results
Three supervised learning algorithm were selected and build models to predict the incomes of potential donnors.Logistic regression was selected to build final model for prediction, since it leads to the highest testing accuracy and F-score. In addition, based on the model, age, working hours per week, capital gain, education background, marital status are the five most important features to predict the income.
